# Welcome to ATRLF!

Welcome to ATRLF, a new MDDT project; but...

## What is ATRLF?

ATRLF (**A**nother **T**ools **R**ognition **L**anguage **F**ormat) It is a specialized library for creating programming languages, efficiently and quickly.

Apart from this, it offers good performance and great flexibility.

## How does ATRLF help me?

ATRLF can help you create DSLs or scripts (even programming languages) quickly and easily, without having much knowledge of the compilation world.

And not only that, it can also help you understand how compiler structures are made.

That the same project offers a Tokenizer (Scanner) and a Parser to create Nodes.

## How to use it?

### How to use the project

To use it, you first have to use the `LanguageTokenizer` since that will give us some **Tokens** already built.

    LanguageTokenizer myTokenizer = new LanguageTokenizer(new MyTokenizerMain(?);
}
```
